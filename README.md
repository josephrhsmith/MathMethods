# Computation in Math Methods Courses 
Jupyter Notebooks in Python Developed For a Sophomore-Level Mathematical Methods For Physics Course

Many of the notebooks were originally developed by [@tachycline](https://github.com/tachycline) and adapted for my courses. Notebooks in the main folder can generally be completed in any order, although the [Python as a Calculator Notebook](01_Python_Calculator.ipynb) should be completed first (if the user is not familiar with python). Some notebooks assume familiarity with [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/), which is introduced in the [Symbolic Computation Notebook](01_Symbolic_Computation.ipynb). Notebooks used for classroom visualizations/demonstrations are also included. If you have questions about using these resources email me via the contact information on my [ORCiD record](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5978-6840). 

These notebooks can be supplemented with other resources such as those from the [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), [Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientists](https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html), and [PICUP](https://www.compadre.org/picup/).
